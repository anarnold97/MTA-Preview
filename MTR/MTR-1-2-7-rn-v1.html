			Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases.

			Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (MTR) provides an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that simplifies the migration and modernization of Java applications, such as migrating JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7 to 8 or migrating from any other application server towards EAP at scale. MTR provides the same migration solution as provided in the Migration Toolkit for Applications 5 releases.
		</p><p>
			These release notes cover all Z-stream releases of MTR 1.2 with the most recent release listed first.

					A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which was utilized by Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (MTR). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an <code class="literal">RST_STREAM</code> frame to cancel it. This creates additional workload for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, while avoiding any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINDUP-4072">(WINDUP-4072)</a>
