<title>Making open source more inclusive</title>
<simpara>Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases.

<title>Technical changes</title>
<simpara>This release has the following technical changes:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Simplified the creation of vSphere providers</title>
<para>In earlier releases of MTV, users had to specify a fingerprint when creating a vSphere provider. This required users to retrieve the fingerprint from the server that vCenter runs on. MTV no longer requires this fingerprint as an input, but rather computes it from the specified certificate in the case of a secure connection or automatically retrieves it from the server that runs vCenter/ESXi in the case of an insecure connection.</para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Redesigned the migration plan creation dialog</title>
<para>The user interface console has improved the process of creating a migration plan. The new migration plan dialog enables faster creation of migration plans.</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>It includes only the minimal settings that are required, while you can confirgure advanced settings separately. The new dialog also provides defaults for network and storage mappings, where applicable. The new dialog can also be invoked from the the <literal>Provider</literal> &gt; <literal>Virtual Machines</literal> tab, after selecting the virtual machines to migrate. It also better aligns with the user experience in the OCP console.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title><literal>virtual machine preferences</literal> have replaced OpenShift templates</title>
<para>The <literal>virtual machine preferences</literal> have replaced OpenShift templates. MTV currently falls back to using OpenShift templates when a relevant preference is not available.</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Custom mappings of guest operating system type to virtual machine preference can be configured using <literal>config</literal> maps. This is in order to use custom virtual machine preferences, or to support more guest operating system types.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Full support for migration from OVA</title>
<para>Migration from OVA moves from being a Technical Preview and is now a fully supported feature.</para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>The VM is posted with its desired <literal>Running</literal> state</title>
<para>MTV creates the VM with its desired <literal>Running</literal> state on the target provider, instead of creating the VM and then running it as an additional operation. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-794">(MTV-794)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>The <literal>must-gather</literal> logs can now be loaded only by using the CLI</title>
<para>The MTV web console can no longer download logs. With this update, you must download <literal>must-gather</literal> logs by using CLI commands. For more information, see <link xlink:href="https://github.com/openshift/must-gather-operator">Must Gather Operator</link>.</para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MTV no longer runs <literal>pvc-init</literal> pods when migrating from vSphere</title>
<para>MTV no longer runs <literal>pvc-init</literal> pods during cold migration from a vSphere provider to the OpenShift cluster that MTV is deployed on. However, in other flows where data volumes are used, they are set with the <literal>cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.bind.immediate.requested</literal> annotation, and CDI runs first-consume pods for storage classes with volume binding mode <literal>WaitForFirstConsumer</literal>.</para>

<title>New features and enhancements</title>
<simpara>This section provides features and enhancements introduced in Migration Toolkit for Virtualization 2.6.</simpara>
<section xml:id="new-features-and-enhancements-26-3_release-notes">
<title>New features and enhancements 2.6.3</title>
<formalpara>
<title>Support for migrating LUKS-encrypted devices in migrations from vSphere</title>
<para>You can now perform cold migrations from a vSphere provider of VMs whose virtual disks are encrypted by Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS). <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-831">(MTV-831)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Specifying the primary disk when migrating from vSphere</title>
<para>You can now specify the primary disk when you migrate VMs from vSphere with more than one bootable disk. This avoids MTV automatically attempting to convert the first bootable disk that it detects while it examines all the disks of a virtual machine. This feature is needed because the first bootable disk is not necessarily the disk that the VM is expected to boot from in OpenShift Virtualization. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1079">(MTV-1079)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Links to remote provider UIs</title>
<para>You can now remotely access the UI of a remote cluster when you create a source provider. For example, if the provider is a remote Red Hat Virtualization RHV cluster, MTV adds a link to the remote RHV web console when you define the provider. This feature makes it easier for you to manage and debug a migration from remote clusters. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1054">(MTV-1054)</link></para>
</formalpara>

<title>New features and enhancements 2.6.0</title>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration from vSphere over a secure connection</title>
<para>You can now specify a CA certificate that can be used to authenticate the server that runs vCenter or ESXi, depending on the specified SDK endpoint of the vSphere provider. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-530">(MTV-530)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration to or from a remote OpenShift over a secure connection</title>
<para>You can now specify a CA certificate that can be used to authenticate the API server of a remote OpenShift cluster. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-728">(MTV-728)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration from an ESXi server without going through vCenter</title>
<para>MTV enables the configuration of vSphere providers with the SDK of ESXi. You need to select ESXi as the Endpoint type of the vSphere provider and specify the URL of the SDK of the ESXi server. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-514">(MTV-514)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration of image-based VMs from OpenStack</title>
<para>MTV supports the migration of VMs that were created from images in OpenStack. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-644">(MTV-644)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration of VMs with Fibre Channel LUNs from RHV</title>
<para>MTV supports migrations of VMs that are set with Fibre Channel (FC) LUNs from RHV. As with other LUN disks, you need to ensure the OpenShift nodes have access to the FC LUNs. During the migrations, the FC LUNs are detached from the source VMs in RHV and attached to the migrated VMs in OpenShift. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-659">(MTV-659)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Preserve CPU types of VMs that are migrated from RHV</title>
<para>MTV sets the CPU type of migrated VMs in OpenShift with their custom CPU type in RHV. In addition, a new option was added to migration plans that are set with RHV as a source provider to preserve the original CPU types of source VMs. When this option is selected, MTV identifies the CPU type based on the cluster configuration and sets this CPU type for the migrated VMs, for which the source VMs are not set with a custom CPU. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-547">(MTV-547)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Validation for RHEL 6 guest operating system is now available when migrating VMs with RHEL 6 guest operating system</title>
<para>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 does not support RHEL 6 as a guest operating system. Therefore, RHEL 6 is not supported in OpenShift Virtualization. With this update, a validation of RHEL 6 guest operating system was added to OpenShift Virtualization. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-413">(MTV413)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Automatic retrieval of CA certificates for the providerâ€™s URL in the console</title>
<para>The ability to retrieve CA certificates, which was available in previous versions, has been restored. The <literal>vSphere Verify certificate</literal> option is in the <literal>add-provider</literal> dialog. This option was removed in the transition to the Red Hat OpenShift console and has now been added to the console. This functionality is also available for RHV, OpenStack, and OpenShift providers now. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-737">(MTV-737)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Validation of a specified VDDK image</title>
<para>MTV validates the availability of a VDDK image that is specified for a vSphere provider on the target OpenShift name as part of the validation of a migration plan. MTV also checks whether the <literal>libvixDiskLib.so</literal> symbolic link (symlink) exists within the image. If the validation fails, the migration plan cannot be started. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-618">(MTV-618)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Add a warning and partial support for TPM</title>
<para>MTV presents a warning when attempting to migrate a VM that is set with a TPM device from RHV or vSphere. The migrated VM in OpenShift would be set with a TPM device but without the content of the TPM device on the source environment. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-378">(MTV-378)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Plans that failed to migrate VMs can now be edited</title>
<para>With this update, you can edit plans that have failed to migrate any VMs. Some plans fail or are canceled because of incorrect network and storage mappings. You can now edit these plans until they succeed. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-779">(MTV-779)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Validation rules are now available for OVA</title>

<formalpara>
<title>Preserve IP option for Windows does not preserve all settings</title>
<para>In earlier releases of MTV, while migrating a Windows 2022 Server with a static IP address assigned, and selecting the <emphasis role="strong">Preserve static IPs</emphasis> option, after a successful Windows migration, while the node started and the IP address was preserved, the subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers were not preserved. This resulted in an incomplete migration, and the customer was forced to log in locally from the console to fully configure the network. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.6.4. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1286">(MTV-1286)</link></para>

<formalpara>
<title>Migration scheduling does not take into account that <literal>virt-v2v</literal> copies disks sequentially (vSphere only)</title>
<para>In earlier releases of MTV, there was a problem with the way MTV interpreted the <literal>controller_max_vm_inflight</literal> setting for vSphere to schedule migrations. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.6.3. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1191">(MTV-1191)</link></para>

<formalpara>
<title>Cold migrations fail after changing the ESXi network (vSphere only)</title>
<para>In earlier versions of MTV, cold migrations from a vSphere provider with an ESXi SDK endpoint failed if any network was used except for the default network for disk transfers. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.6.3. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1180">(MTV-1180)</link></para>

<title>Warm migrations over an ESXi network are stuck in <literal>DiskTransfer</literal> state (vSphere only)</title>
<para>In earlier versions of MTV, warm migrations over an ESXi network from a vSphere provider with a vCenter SDK endpoint were stuck in <literal>DiskTransfer</literal> state because MTV was unable to locate image snapshots.

</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Leftover PVCs are in <literal>Lost</literal> state after cold migrations</title>
<para>In earlier versions of MTV, after cold migrations, there were leftover PVCs that had a status of <literal>Lost</literal> instead of being deleted, even after the migration plan that created them was archived and deleted. Investigation showed that this was because importer pods were retained after copying, by default, rather than in only specific cases. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.6.3. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1095">(MTV-1095)</link></para>

<para>In earlier versions of MTV, some VMs that were imported from vSphere were not mapped to a template in OpenShift while other VMs, with the same guest operating system, were mapped to the corresponding template. Investigations indicated that this was because vSphere stopped reporting the operating system after not receiving updates from VMware tools for some time. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.6.3 by taking the value of the operating system from the output of the investigation that <literal>virt-v2v</literal> performs on the disks. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1046">(MTV-1046)</link></para>

<para>A flaw was found in the <literal>net/mail</literal> Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of MTV. The <literal>ParseAddressList</literal> function incorrectly handles comments, text in parentheses, and display names. As this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers. This flaw has been resolved in MTV 2.6.2.</para>

<para>A flaw was found in the <literal>crypto/x509</literal> Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of MTV. Verifying a certificate chain that contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm causes <literal>Certificate.Verify</literal> to panic. This affects all <literal>crypto/tls</literal> clients and servers that set <literal>Config.ClientAuth</literal> to <literal>VerifyClientCertIfGiven</literal> or <literal>RequireAndVerifyClientCert</literal>.

<title>VMs with multiple disks that are migrated from vSphere and OVA files are not being fully copied</title>
<para>In MTV 2.6.0, there was a problem in copying VMs with multiple disks from VMware vSphere and from OVA files. The migrations appeared to succeed but all the disks were transferred to the same PV in the target environment while other disks were empty. In some cases, bootable disks were overridden, so the VM could not boot. In other cases, data from the other disks was missing.

<para>In MTV 2.6.0,  migrations from one Red Hat OpenShift cluster to another failed when the time to transfer the disks of a VM exceeded the time to live (TTL) of the Export API in OpenShift, which was set to 2 hours by default. The problem was resolved in MTV 2.6.1 by setting the default TTL of the Export API to 12 hours, which greatly reduces the possibility of an expiration of the Export API. Additionally, you can increase or decrease the TTL setting as needed. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1052">(MTV-1052)</link></para>

<title>New features and enhancements</title>
<simpara>This release has the following features and improvements:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Migration of OVA files from VMware vSphere</title>
<para>In MTV 2.6, you can migrate using Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files that were created by VMware vSphere as source providers. <link xlink:href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-336">(MTV-336)</link></para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>Migration of OVA files that were not created by VMware vSphere but are compatible with vSphere might succeed. However, migration of such files is not supported by MTV. MTV supports only OVA files created by VMware vSphere.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Migration using one or more Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files as a source provider is a Technology Preview.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Migration using one or more Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files as a source provider is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product
features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.</simpara>

<simpara>This release has the following resolved issues:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Flaw was found in jsrsasign package which is vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy</title>
<para>Versions of the package <literal>jsrsasign</literal> before 11.0.0, used in earlier releases of MTV, are vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy in the RSA PKCS1.5 or RSA-OAEP decryption process. This discrepancy means an attacker could decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting this vulnerability. However, exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key. This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.5.5 by upgrading the package <literal>jsrasign</literal> to version 11.0.0.</para>

<formalpara>
<title>Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)</title>
<para>A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol. In previous releases of MTV, the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, which resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.</para>

<title>Gin Web Framework does not properly sanitize filename parameter of <literal>Context.FileAttachment</literal> function</title>
<para>A flaw was found in the Gin-Gonic Gin Web Framework, used by MTV. The filename parameter of the <literal>Context.FileAttachment</literal> function was not properly sanitized. This flaw in the package could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions caused by improper input validation by the filename parameter of the <literal>Context.FileAttachment</literal> function. A maliciously created filename could cause the <literal>Content-Disposition</literal> header to be sent with an unexpected filename value, or otherwise modify the <literal>Content-Disposition</literal> header.</para>

<title>Filesystem overhead configurable</title>
<para>In earlier releases of MTV 2.6, the filesystem overhead for new persistent volumes was hard-coded to 10%.

In other filesystem types, the hard-coded overhead was too high, resulting in excessive storage consumption.</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In MTV 2.5.3, the filesystem overhead can be configured, as it is no longer hard-coded. If your migration allocates persistent volumes without CDI, you can adjust the file system overhead.

<formalpara>
<title>Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)</title>
<para>A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol. In previous releases of MTV, the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, which resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.4.3 and 2.5.2. It is advised to update to one of these versions of MTV or later.</simpara>

</formalpara>
<simpara>The following error appears in the missing resourceâ€™s <literal>current.log</literal> file when it is downloaded from the web console or created with the <literal>must-gather</literal> tool: <literal>error: expected 'logs [-f] [-p] (POD | TYPE/NAME) [-c CONTAINER]'.</literal> (<link xlink:href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2023260"><emphasis role="strong">BZ#2023260</emphasis></link>)</simpara>

</formalpara>
<simpara>As a temporary workaround, the <literal>importer</literal> pod is removed at the end of the precopy stage so that the precopy succeeds.
