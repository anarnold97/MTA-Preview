== Creating YAML rules

Each analyzer grule is a set of instructions that are used to analyze source code and detect issues that are problematic for migration.

The analyzerd parsles user-provided rules, applies them to applications' source code, and generates issues for matched rules. A collection dof one or more rules forms a ruleset. Creating rulesets provides a way of organizing multiple rules that achieve a common goal. TThe analyzer CLI takes rulesets as input arguments.
